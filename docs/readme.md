# SkyWalking 9.x showcase

**This showcase would follow the latest changes of SkyWalking 9.x, even before the official release.**

This showcase repository includes an example music application and other manifests to demonstrate the main features of
SkyWalking. The music application is composed of several microservices that are written in different programming
languages. Here is the architecture:

```

## Usage

**Please run the showcase in a brand new test cluster, otherwise the undeploy process may delete
some resources that you have installed before running this showcase (for example cert-manager).
If you don't do this in a new test cluster, it's all on your own risks!**

The showcase uses [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and Docker containers to run commands, so please make
sure you have `make` installed and Docker daemon running.

### Prerequisites

To deploy the full features of this showcase application, you may need up to 4 CPU cores and 4 GB memory, please
increase the Docker daemon resources or Kubernetes cluster resources if you find containers / Pods failed to start up.
Alternatively, you can also only deploy part of the features that interest you if you don't want to increase the
resources, via the guide in [Customization](#customization).

### Quick Start

Make sure you have a running Kubernetes cluster and `kubectl` can access to that cluster.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/apache/skywalking-showcase.git
cd skywalking-showcase
make deploy.kubernetes
```

This will install SkyWalking components, including OAP in cluster mode with 2 nodes, SkyWalking UI,
microservices with SkyWalking agent, microservices without SkyWalking agent but managed by Istio,
2 Pods to mimic virtual machines and export metrics to SkyWalking, and enable kubernetes cluster monitoring as well as
SkyWalking self observability.

For more advanced deployments, check [Customization](#customization) documentation below.

Notice, when run this showcase locally such as KinD, the images are downloaded inside the KinD, which could take over 10 mins(depend on local network).
Rerun `make deploy.kubernetes` if some timeout errors break the process.

### Customization

The variables defined in [`Makefile.in`](../Makefile.in) can be overridden to customize the showcase, by specifying an
environment variable with the same name, e.g.:

```shell
export ES_VERSION=7.14.0
make <target>
```

or directly specifying in the `make` command, e.g.: `make <target> ES_VERSION=7.14.0`.

Run `make help` to get more information.

### Features

The showcase is composed of a set of scenarios with feature flags, you can deploy some of them that interest you by
overriding the `FEATURE_FLAGS` variable defined in [`Makefile.in`](../Makefile.in), as documented
in [Customization](#customization), e.g.:

```shell
make deploy.kubernetes FEATURE_FLAGS=single-node,agent
```

Feature flags for different platforms ([Kubernetes](#kubernetes) and [Docker Compose](#docker-compose)) are not
necessarily the same so make sure to specify the right feature flags.

Currently, the features supported are:

### Kubernetes

To deploy the example application in Kubernetes, please make sure that you have `kubectl` command available, and it can
connect to the Kubernetes cluster successfully.

If you don't have a running cluster, you can also leverage [KinD (Kubernetes in Docker)](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io)
or [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io) to create a cluster.

Run `kubectl get nodes` to check the connectivity before going to next step. The typical error message that indicates
your `kubectl` cannot connect to a cluster is:

```text
The connection to the server localhost:8080 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?
```

#### Deploy

```shell
# Deploy
make deploy.kubernetes
# Undeploy
make undeploy.kubernetes
# Redeploy
make redeploy.kubernetes # equivalent to make undeploy.kubernetes deploy.kubernetes
```

### Docker Compose

#### Deploy

```shell
# Deploy
make deploy.docker
# Undeploy
make undeploy.docker
# Redeploy
make redeploy.docker # equivalent to make undeploy.docker deploy.docker
```

## Traffic Flow

After deploy the showcase, the business system would send monitoring traffic to the OAP node, and one agent/sidecar connect to one OAP node directly.

### Satellite
If the business traffic is unbalanced, it would cause the OAP node receive unbalanced monitoring data. So, you could add the Satellite component.
After deploy the showcase with the satellite component, the monitoring traffic would send to the Satellite service, and satellite
load balances the traffic to the OAP nodes.
